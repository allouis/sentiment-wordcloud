# Wordcloud project

To install:
```
npm install
```
Depending on your setup you may need to `sudo` the above command.

```
npm run build
```

This will build our `app.js`

Sometimes the build will fail, I haven't quite worked out why, but this can be fixed by running
```
npm install handlebars
```
> N.B. I cannot replicate this on my other machine - may be a problem with my personal setup
